# Welcome to the Climate Modeling Alliance (CliMA)

### Building the next generation of climate models.

---

## 🙋‍♀️ What is CliMA?

We are an alliance of scientists, engineers, and applied mathematicians building a new generation of Earth system models (ESMs). Our mission is to pioneer a new, **data-informed** and **physics-based** approach to climate modeling.

We are developing a model that:
* Learns from the wealth of Earth observations from space and from the ground.
* Runs efficiently on modern computing architectures with GPUs.
* **Delivers actionable predictions, from sub-seasonal to decadal scales, to inform critical decisions in agriculture, infrastructure, and resource planning.**

Our goal is to deliver the most accurate, usable, and scalable climate model in the world.
